### Aspiring Academic Seeking Teaching Assistant Position 

I'm an aspiring academic at the University of Melbourne. I have many years’ experience both in negotiation and university-level teaching. My negotiation experience encompasses both theory—I have a Master’s degree in Negotiation and Dispute Resolution—and practice—I have experience as a mediator and as a negotiator on behalf of clients as a litigation lawyer. I also have many years’ online teaching experience, and experience with Canvas.
