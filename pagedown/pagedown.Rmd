### Aspiring Academic Seeking a Research Assistant Position

I'm an Honours Psychology student interested in Cognitive Psychology, and particularly its intersection with Moral Psychology; and how new data analysis techniques can elucidate the perennial questions in these domains. Previously, I worked as a litigation lawyer so I’ve also got a healthy interest in the theory of law too. I also have experience with R, Python, MATLAB, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git for creating experiments and/or analysing data.
